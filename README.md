## Hotel Reservation Website (HReW) 

**About:**

HReW is a web application for managing hotel reservations. It allows users to search for available rooms, book reservations, and manage their booking details. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for setting up and using the application.

**Features:**

* **User-friendly interface:** HReW offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to easily navigate and make reservations.
* **Room Availability Search:** Users can search for available rooms based on their preferred dates, room type, and number of guests.
* **Secure Booking System:** The booking system is secure and encrypts user data to protect sensitive information.
* **Reservation Management:** Users can view, modify, and cancel their reservations directly through the app.
* **Admin Panel:** An admin panel allows hotel staff to manage room availability, set prices, and view reservation details.

**Technologies used:**

* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Back-end: PHP
* Database: MySQL

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/FlavienNgueukam/hotel_booking--reservation--website
```

2. **Set up the database:**

Follow the instructions in the `hotel_db.sql` file to create and configure the MySQL database.

3. **Run the application:**

    **Place the application files in the htdocs folder:**

      - Locate the XAMPP installation directory on your computer. It's usually under `C:\xampp` on Windows and `/opt/lampp` on Linux.
      - Inside this directory, you'll find a folder called `htdocs`. This is the designated directory for web content.
      - Copy the entire application folder (containing its files and subfolders) into the `htdocs` folder.

   **Start the Apache and MySQL services:**

      - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
      - Click the "Start" buttons next to Apache and MySQL (if your application uses a database).
      - Wait for the services to start successfully. You should see green "Running" indicators next to them.

   **Access the application in your browser:**

      - Open a web browser and type the following URL in the address bar:

   ```
   http://localhost/hotel_booking--reservation--website/
   ```

   **Additional considerations:**

   - **Database configuration:** If your application uses a database, ensure it's configured to connect to the MySQL server running within XAMPP. Check the application's documentation for specific connection details.
   - **Dynamic content:** XAMPP supports PHP, Perl, and Python, so you can run applications written in these languages.
   - **Specific application instructions:** Some applications may have additional setup steps or configuration requirements. Refer to the application's documentation for specific guidance.
   - **Port conflicts:** If you encounter port conflicts with other applications, you can change the default ports used by Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel.


4. **Visit the application:**

- Open a web browser and paste the following URL:

```
  http://localhost/hotel_booking--reservation--website/index.php
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic example of a hotel reservation website. You can customize and extend the features as needed.
* Refer to the `documentation` folder for detailed documentation on the project.
* Feel free to contribute to the project by creating pull requests with your improvements.
